### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm an entrepreneur, digital marketer, and data analyst. To find out more about me, visit my [website](https://www.martijnvulto.com/) or follow me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/martijnvulto/).

I occasionally use GitHub to store bits of code, but as coding is not the main part of my work, don't expect to find too much here.
